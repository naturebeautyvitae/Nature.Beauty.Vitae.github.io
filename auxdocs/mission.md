“Agency and Intentions in Artificial Intelligence” (AIAI) directly connects to the VMF’s mission to encourage research on language and knowledge. Specifically, our keynote speakers and attendees will engage with AI systems and LLMs as agent-like language users that invite serious study, a conversation that aligns with VRF’s goal to “promote and advance research into language as a knowledge system.” It is because humans and LLMs communicate through language, a powerful medium for transmitting and shaping human understanding, that we believe it’s so important to clarify the theoretical basis for AI systems as unique agents and collaborators.
 
 Additionally, AIAI is intended to connect experts from multiple disciplines and career stages in a fruitful discussion about the theoretical underpinnings of AI and LLM systems. The linguists, philosophers, and cognitive scientists at AIAI will include junior and senior researchers, each with unique perspectives on a constantly evolving set of technologies. Since the conference is in person, we look forward to seeing scholars share their ideas in a congenial setting and network with the people behind those ideas so they can form new collaborations.
  
  AIAI takes seriously the idea that “there are still big gaps in our knowledge” of language, a “unique capacity of human beings”—we will also artfully challenge whether it ultimately is unique to humans. We hope to contribute to language research by exploring one of humanity’s most impressive and uncertain language-based constructions: AI systems and LLMs.
